    "text": "Additionally, a set of guidelines will be presented as to how practitioners should decide which method is best for their project and data needs. The focus of this workshop will be on satellite telemetry data (i.e., GPS, Argos, light-level geolocation) for aquatic species using the R programming language, but is applicable to terrestrial species and some instances of acoustic telemetry.\nThis workshop assumes that participants have an intermediate knowledge of the R programming language and are generally familiar with animal telemetry data.
