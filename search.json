This will slightly differ depending on the operating system that is used. This should only be required if downloading directly from GitHub, so it will likely be easier to follow the instructions at the bottom of the page first before trying to install the developer tools described below.\nFor Mac users: Per instructions from the foieGras README:\n\nEnsure you have installed the Command Line Tools for Xcode by executing xcode-select –install in the terminal; or you can download the latest version from the URL (free developer registration may be required). A full Xcode install uses up a lot of disk space and is not required. Also, ensure you have a suitable Gnu Fortran compiler installed (e.g., https://github.com/fxcoudert/gfortran-for-macOS/releases).\n\nFor PC users: Please download RTools, which should install all of the necessary developer tools for you."

    "text": "Required R packages\nAll of the below packages can be installed directly from CRAN using install.packages() within the R console. However, more recent versions are likely available from the package’s GitHub repo or from an R-Universe repo. This is particularly important for the foieGras package. \n\ndata wrangling and visualization\n\ntidyverse\nlubridate\nfurrr\nfuture\nplotly\ntictoc\nMetBrewer\nviridis\nunits\n\nspatial analysis\n\nsf\nrnaturalearth\nrerddapXtracto\n\nbehavioral state estimation\n\nfoieGras\nmomentuHMM\nbayesmove\n\nspace-use estimation\n\namt\nmove\n\n\nSpecifically for the foieGras package, the below instructions are copied from the package’s README:\nAs of v1.0-5, {foieGras} is available via R-Universe. This is where the latest stable version can always be found. Installation is simple:\n\n# install from R-universe repository\ninstall.packages(\"foieGras\", \n                 repos = \"https://ianjonsen.r-universe.dev\")\n\nHowever, this will not install any of {foieGras}’s Suggested packages, which add extra functionality such as path re-routing around land. To ensure all Suggested packages, either from R-Universe or CRAN are also installed:\n\ninstall.packages(\"foieGras\", \n                 repos = c(\"https://cloud.r-project.org\",\n                           \"https://ianjonsen.r-universe.dev\"),\n                 dependencies = \"Suggests\")\n\ninstall.packages will tell you that both a binary (CRAN, v0.7-6) and a source (R-Universe, >= v1.0-7) version exist but the source version is newer. Answer Yes to install the source version, provided you have the appropriate compiler tools described above. \nIt is recommended to install the latest version due to increased model speed and functionality, which is expected to only be hosted via GitHub or R-Universe. However, the CRAN version can be installed if problems with installation cannot be resolved."
